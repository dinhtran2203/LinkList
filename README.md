# LinkList
understanding of linked lists, dynamic memory and pointers in C++
Create an ordered linked list to store integer values. This program must include the following functions (as listed in 1) and must test the functionality by following the given testing instructions (as listed in 2)

    Define functions to:
        Traverse and print to file the values on the linked list*
        Insert an element into the linked list
        Delete a value (if it exists) from the linked list (be sure to provide the value as the parameter)
    Test the functions using a random number generator**
        Construct a linked list of at least size 60, but no more than 100
        Traverse the linked list, storing values in an output file called “OutputA.txt”
        Delete the smallest value on the linked list
        Delete the largest value on the linked list
        Delete any value from the “middle” of the linked list (not smallest or largest, just any other value)
        Traverse the updated linked list, storing values in an output file called “OutputB.txt”
